New optimization including the images that have been deactivated during the previous optimization.

Aspect ratio optimized (est_aspect_ratio = 1) -> both components of fc are estimated (DEFAULT).
Principal point optimized (center_optim=1) - (DEFAULT). To reject principal point, set center_optim=0
Skew not optimized (est_alpha=0) - (DEFAULT)
Distortion not fully estimated (defined by the variable est_dist):
     Sixth order distortion not estimated (est_dist(5)=0) - (DEFAULT) .
