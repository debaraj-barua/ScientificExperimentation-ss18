# Documentations for Calibration:
- [Camera Calibration Toolbox Matlab](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/)
    - Go to the [download page](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/download/index.html), and retrieve the latest version of the complete camera calibration toolbox for Matlab.
    - Store the individual matlab files (.m files) into a unique folder TOOLBOX_calib (default folder name).
    - Run Matlab and add the location of the folder TOOLBOX_calib to the main matlab path. This procedure will let you call any of the matlab toolbox functions from anywhere. Under Windows, this may be easily done by using the path editing menu. Under Unix or Linux, you may use the command path or addpath (use the help command for function description).
    - Run the main matlab calibration function calib_gui (or calib) from the images folder.   
 - [Calibration Example](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/htmls/example.html)
    - Follow this.
