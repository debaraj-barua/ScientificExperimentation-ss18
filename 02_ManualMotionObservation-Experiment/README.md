# Task

1. Complete assignment 1.2 from the manual and upload deliverable 1.2

---

## Assigntment 1.2

1. Refine your experiment design according to feedback in class, if necessary
2. Run the requested experiment, by driving the robot 20 time on an arc to the right, 20 times
straight ahead, and 20 times on an arc to the left with the same magnitude, but opposite
direction of the commanded curvature to the right
3. Record the end poses and any other observation that may prove useful for later analysis of
the experiment
4. Describe in writing the final robots design, the final measurement process and any observation made during execution of the experiment
5. Think of suitable methods to visualise the observed motion. Provide visualisations of the
overall motions as well as of the spread-out of the stop positions of the robot. If applicable,
show differences between the left and right arc experiments
6. Perform some statistical data analysis and give an estimation of the achieved accuracy and
precision of your measurements

## Deliverable 1.2

Write a report detailing your execution of the experiment, including all observations made while
running the robot. Especially detail and visualize the observed robot end poses and report statistical
precision of the observed end poses. Summarise your findings, does the observed behaviour of the
robot matches your expectations? Your report should cover:
1. The relevant aspects of the design of the robot, especially how you mark the stop position
and how you ensure identical start positions
2. The program and parameters used to drive the robot
3. Any observation made during the execution that may help one understand the outcome of
the experiments (see also next week)
4. The observed data as Excel or LibreOffice Calc file or in a similar machine-readable form
5. Visualisation of the end poses as well as visual documentation of all aspects of setup and
execution you deem important
6. An estimate of the accuracy and precision of the observed data, including how you arrived
at these estimates and why they are plausible
