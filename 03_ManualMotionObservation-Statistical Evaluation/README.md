# Task

1. Complete assignment 2 from the manual and upload deliverable 2

---

## Assigntment 2

1. Fix and, if necessary, rerun your experiment according to the feedback in class
2. Compare the observed and commanded motions: do they fit? if not, describe possible causes
for this
3. Fit a Gaussian to your data and judge if the data is truly Gaussian or if it follows another
distribution
4. Compare the estimated uncertainty of the measurement process itself with the statistical
uncertainty of the observed end poses

## Deliverable 2

Update your previous weekâ€™s report and add a description of the test for a match with a Gaussian
distribution as well as a description of the observed differences between the observed and the
computed motion and the actual and expected accuracy and precision. Include appropriate figures,
diagrams, and images backing up any claims you make. The report must be self-contained and
provide enough details to support any statement you make. If applicable, include a section on
problems encountered. Your update should cover:

1. Any possible pre-processing of your data, like outlier detection and removal
2. Fit of a Gaussian, either two individual ones in the x and y directions for each of the three
cases or a proper two-dimensional distribution per case
3. Check whether the data are actually distributed according to a Gaussian distribution
4. List of used software, including source of any function you wrote for performing your analysis
5. An answer to the following question: When analysing the data with respect to the executed
motions, which characteristic of the data do you establish here: the accuracy, the precision,
or both?
